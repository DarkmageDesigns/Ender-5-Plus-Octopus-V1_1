# Ender 5 Plus with Octopus V1.1

Full working config complete with a host of useful macros, including:

screw tilt

z tilt

KAMP (install via their github - https://github.com/kyleisah/Klipper-Adaptive-Meshing-Purging)

print start/end

and many others. 

Some are my own work and some borrow from elsewhere. 
Noted as appropriate. 

I strongly advise that if you use my macros, you use all of them, otherwise you will get errors and prints will fail.
