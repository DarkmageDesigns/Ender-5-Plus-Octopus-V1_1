# KlipperMacros
Macros I use with Klipper on my Ender 5 Plus

I'm running an Ender 5 Plus with Klipper via mainsail.
I have a MicroSwiss NG direct drive

I have a number of macros that borrow or are whole cloth the work of someone else. These are noted and sourced as needed.
This repository is mostly for if I lose all my macros in some sort of freak trampolining accident and need to start from scratch.

That being said, I'm getting better at macros and hope they might help some people, as many have required extensive googling to put together.
