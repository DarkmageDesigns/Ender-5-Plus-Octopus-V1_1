[z_tilt]
# A list of X,Y coordinates (one per line; subsequent lines
# indented) describing the location of each bed "pivot point". The
# "pivot point" is the point where the bed attaches to the given Z
# stepper. It is described using nozzle coordinates (the XY position
# of the nozzle if it could move directly above the point). The
# first entry corresponds to stepper_z, the second to stepper_z1,
# the third to stepper_z2, etc. This parameter must be provided.

# A list of X,Y coordinates (one per line; subsequent lines
# indented) that should be probed during a Z_TILT_ADJUST command.
# Specify coordinates of the nozzle and be sure the probe is above
# the bed at the given nozzle coordinates. This parameter must be
# provided.

# If retries are enabled then retry if largest and smallest probed
# points differ more than retry_tolerance. Note the smallest unit of
# change here would be a single step. However if you are probing
# more points than steppers then you will likely have a fixed
# minimum value for the range of probed points which you can learn
